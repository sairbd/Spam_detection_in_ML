# Spam_detection_in_Machine Language
This repository contains machine learning code for classifying emails as spam or non-spam. Using a labeled email dataset, these scripts implement various ML algorithms to train and evaluate spam detection models.
This machine learning classification is my final year's project.
In this ML I've used four(4) supervised machine learning languages written in Python. They are as follows: 1. Logistic Regression, 2. Random Forest, 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
We can implement all four models using scikit-learn and evaluate them on the same dataset.
